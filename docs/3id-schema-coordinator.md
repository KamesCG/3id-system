# 3ID Schema Coordinator
The decentralized web is a unique and intersting place. It's chaotic, adaptive and bound to evolve regularily. Fortunately, 3Box provides predictive content storage and messaging patterns to help tap into evolving communities and networks. However, when you tap into new data sources, in a decentralized world, at best no data is returned. At worst, it's incredibly rich, and complex data, but with no mappings, indexes and understanding of how to process the data.

# Unique and Adaptive Profiles
Decentralized identity is a larelgy unexplored and untapped idea. What's likely to emerge in the coming years will undoubedtly be complex. Individuals, developers, teams, organizations, and institutions will likely explore 1,000's if not 10,000's of decentralized content storage patterns. This is a good thing. And we shouldn't worry to much about mapping every single instance of every different decentralized storage strategy. But the decentralized identity (specifically 3Box community) would probably benefit with a simple method for sharing the localized standards that emerge.

Patterns and best practices will emerge with all the experimentation. Patterns for managing adaptive communications between decentralized identities and the rest of the digital world.
